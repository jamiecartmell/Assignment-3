                <br>
                <p> Founded at the beginning of 2023, Simply Chef is the result of the
                    relentless dedication and passion, Jamie Cartmell. My journey began
                    with a deep-seated commitment to our customers and a shared sense of duty to make a
                    difference in
                    their lives.
                    <br><br>
                    I embarked on this adventure from a 'humble' start, where long nights and seven-day
                    workweeks were
                    our steadfast companions. This hands-on approach allowed us to remain intricately
                    connected not only
                    to our customers but also to our valued suppliers and the very heart of our operations.
                    <br><br>
                    At Simply Chef, we care deeply about the experiences you have with us. It's a commitment
                    we take
                    seriously, which is why we continually reinvest every ounce of our energy and resources
                    into
                    enhancing your journey with us. We believe that food is not just sustenance; it's a
                    powerful
                    lifestyle choice that has a profound impact on your well-being.
                    <br><br>
